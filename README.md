Advertising Sales Prediction: Regression ProjectThis project aims to predict Sales based on advertising budgets spent on three different channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. It explores various regression algorithms to identify the most accurate model for forecasting.📊 Dataset DescriptionThe dataset (Advertising.csv) contains the following features:TV: Advertising dollars spent on TV for a single product in a given market (in thousands of dollars).Radio: Advertising dollars spent on Radio.Newspaper: Advertising dollars spent on Newspaper.Sales (Target): Sales of a single product in a given market (in thousands of widgets).🛠️ RequirementsTo run this project, you need the following Python libraries installed:pandasnumpyseabornmatplotlibscikit-learn🚀 Project Workflow1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and duplicates.Outlier Detection: Utilized boxplots for each feature to identify anomalies.Correlation Analysis: Used a Heatmap and Pairplot to visualize the relationship between advertising channels and sales.2. Modeling & RegressionWe implemented and compared four different Machine Learning algorithms:Multiple Linear Regression: Establishing a linear relationship:$$Sales = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1(TV) + \alpha_2(Radio) + \alpha_3(Newspaper)$$Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits data into branches.Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees for better stability.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Predicting sales based on the similarity to other data points.3. Performance MetricsEach model is evaluated using standard regression metrics:MAE (Mean Absolute Error)MSE (Mean Squared Error)RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)$R^2$ Score (Coefficient of Determination)📈 Optimization (Tuning KNN)The project includes a specialized section for optimizing the KNN Regressor:Elbow Method: Iterating through different values of $K$ (1 to 20) to find the minimum RMSE.GridSearchCV: Automated search for the best hyperparameter $K$.🏆 Summary of ResultsThe code evaluates which model provides the highest $R^2$ and lowest RMSE. Typically, for this dataset, Random Forest or tuned KNN provides the highest accuracy compared to simple Linear Regression.
